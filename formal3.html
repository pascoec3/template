			<h1>Background Information</h1>
			<p>Two main branches of economics exist: microeconomics and macroeconomics. Microeconomics 
			examines the actions of individuals and firms, and how they interact. Macroeconomics studies 
			the economy at large, examining inflation, unemployment and GDP, Gross Domestic Product. 
			
	Economics is the sole justification of monetary funds, banking with interest rates, social security, military
	funding, Medicare, Medicaid and many other social programs. Economics focuses on the behavior and interactions 
	of different agents and how economies work together. 
	
Other distinctions within economics include those between positive economics and normative economics. Positive economic
describing ‘what is”, really happening in the economy currently. Normative economics, advocating ‘ what ought to be’ 
happening in the economy. Economic analysis may be applied throughout society, as in business, health care, government,
and finance. Analyses may also be applied to subjects such as crime, education, law, politics, religion, family, etc. 

Economics help to analyze the wealth of different nations. Economists have usually centered their studies on the
analysis of wealth: how wealth is created (production), distributed, and consumed; and how wealth can grow

“In theory, in a free market aggregates of quantity demanded by buyers and quantity supplied by sellers will be equal
and reach economics equilibrium over time in reaction to price changes; in practice, various issues may prevent
equilibrium” (Wiki) Various market structures exist, such as; a monopoly, in which there is only one seller of a 
good or service, an oligopoly, in which there are few sellers of a good or service. Production is the conversion of 
inputs into outputs. Production is a flow and a rate of output over a certain period of time. 

“Economics is a study of man in the ordinary business of life. It enquires how he gets his income and how he uses it. 
Thus, it is on the one side, the study of wealth and on the other and more important side, a part of the study of man.”
(Marshall) 



Supply and Demand
 
Demand is the relation of the quantity that all buyers would be prepared to purchase at each unit price of the good The
law of demand states that price and quantity demanded in a given market are inversely related. So, the higher the price
of a product, the less of it people would be prepared to buy of it. Supply is the relation between the price of a good
and the quantity available for sale at that price, the higher the price at which the good can be sold, the more of it
producers will supply. Market equilibrium occurs where quantity supplied equals quantity demanded, 
“For a given quantity of a consumer good, the point on the demand curve indicates the value, or marginal utility to
consumers for that unit. It measures what the consumer would be prepared to pay for that unit. The corresponding point 
on the supply curve measures marginal cost, the increase in total cost to the supplier for the corresponding unit of 
the good.” (Baumol)

Externalities occur where there are significant social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not 
reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate
a positive externality (less crime, etc.) 

“Public finance is the field of economics that deals with budgeting the revenues and expenditures of a public sector 
entity, usually government. The subject addresses such matters as tax incidence who really pays a particular tax), 
cost-benefit analysis of government programs, effects on economic efficiency and income distribution of different kinds
of spending and taxes, and fiscal politics. The latter, an aspect of public choice theory, models public-sector
behavior analogously to microeconomics, involving interactions of self-interested voters, politicians, and bureaucrats”
(Musgrave)
Growth economics studies factors that explain economic growth – the increase in output per capita of a country over a
long period of time.

 
“The term business cycle refers to economy-wide fluctuations in production, trade and economic activity in general
over several months or years in an economy organized on free-enterprise principles.” (Burns)
