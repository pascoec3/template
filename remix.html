	<p></p>Composing in Context:
		The issue I chose hardly affect my composing of this project because it was my original project that
		we decided to do and give more research on. Composing for this issue helped me to better understand 
		the issue at hand by doing more research by professional documentarians and more professional groups
		such as Frontline and CBS. Problems that I encounters in organizing and composing our documentary was
		deciding how the work would be split, and just how our projected would be made up. How much video we
		needed and how to put it all together. The role that audience played was helpful to address a certain 
		audience to help focus on the tasks at hand. 
	<p></p>Process:
		We selected the issue; by discussing all of our previous assignments that we did and my formal research
		project that I finished earlier was voted to be the best option for us to do. The most challenging 
		part of the project for me was finding the right videos and documentation that we would be able to use
		for our documentary. We had difficulties meeting up and had to use technology to transfer parts of our
		assignments and to put everything together at the end. I did not take a systematic approach, a fellow
		coworker helped very well in setting up an outline for how our project should go. 
	<p></p>Research:
		The research resources that proved to be most beneficial for me was a simple Google search. So many of 
		the first findings were very beneficial for us to complete our project. We were able to find many 
		videos and case studies that we were able to use. The ones that we would refuse to use were the 
		scholarly articles and trade publications that we could use from the MSU Library databases. We were 
		still able to trust the publications from more verified companies and corporations such as CBS. 
	<p></p>Collaboration: 
		The interaction of our group was quite interesting in completing this project. Our one member did not
		ever get back to us or every try to even offer anything in willing to help. The other 2 members were
		very eager to get the project done and constantly asking each other to get their parts done to finish
		the project in time. I don’t believe working in groups for this project was fruitful. I have always 
		preferred to work alone in research projects and am able to stay more focused to complete the tasks
		at hand. 
	<p>Project Management: 
		I feel we planned relatively well to work on this project. We were able to keep in contact and find
		times to meet together to get work done and divide up the work to finish it. If I were to do it over
		again and had more time, I would have definitely arranged to meet more often and for longer times, 
		I know it is difficult with multiple people’s schedule, but when you have more group time you are able
		to get everyone’s thought in and get more work done. I also would have kept very close contact with 
		everyone once they have finished their part of the work and then gathered together to put it all in a
		final mode for everyone to review and make comments and more suggestions. More time can be useful even
		if you slack off more. 
	<p></p>Documentary Design:
		The most effecting aspect of our documentary’s effectiveness is the clips used from reliable sources
		such as CBS and having a clearer voice and images that are able to capture the viewers’ attention and
		get them to fully understand that the major issue is. We made our design decisions by plotting out an 
		outline so we knew how the documentary would go and then in confirmation with the rest of the members 
		to make sure the project and documentary would flow smoothly.
