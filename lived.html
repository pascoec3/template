In today’s world, technology is constantly changing, advances are made, and new discoveries are made every day. Technology improves communications with different companies, countries, people, etc. In my life, I have witnessed many different advances in technology and software updates and developmental programs involves in our world.  In my particular major, Economics, Technology is very important.  Economics is the branch of knowledge concerned with the production, consumption, and transfer of wealth, along with the use of valuable nonrenewable resources. My particular specific piece of technology that has impacted my choice of an economics major has been the development and advancement of the computer and particularly “Excel”. 
	<br><br>In my special field of economics, corporations and government agency’s use Excel for many valuable aspects of their works. My degree programs provide a broad education involving the domestic and international economy and include the study of institutions, concepts, policy, and tools of analysis. Excel is very useful for making spreadsheets, presentations, and keeping track of important numerical facts. Excel helps to keep track of accounting figures: Payable, Receivables, Payroll, etc. Excel also helps for the stock market where I hope to work one day being a stockbroker, investing money into companies. Once I receive my MBA. Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet application developed by Microsoft for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS. It features calculation, graphing tools, & Pivot Tables. 
	<br><br>I chose a Bachelors of Arts in Economics because I am more analytical then I am mathematical. I am able to analyze and determine better results or come up with better approaches to solutions. I’m still able to incorporate my technological advancements to help pursue my career and academic goals. 
	<br><br>Many situations have called for the use of Excel in my lifetime. In many classes and school based assignments, teachers have assigned us to use excel to compete programs and assignments.  Also in the different jobs that I have had led to the use of Excel in everyday work programs and service that I provided. 
“Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets, using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering and financial needs.” (Wikipedia) 
	<br><br>One certain personal experience linked with excel to my career choice was at one job where I worked in accounts receivables for a title company/ law firm.  Using Excel and other programs, I would be in charge for Accounts Receivables for one of our many firms to keep track of how much money we would take in each day and summaries monthly and quarterly. I also worked with constant updates and automatic changes to help make the spreadsheets very advanced with complex formulas and to insure web related information to be affected connected to the spreads. 
	<br><br>Another similar project that I sued excel for in everyday was for the same job, but different work for a different firm. When entering checks and writing them out, along with accepting invoices and billings, there was always references numbers attached to Bills. Spreadsheets helped a lot to help find documents that we constantly being used and to help us find matching PDF’s to the Spreadsheets. I’ve always had a fascination with numbers and with accounting, Very similar to Economics.  I enjoy to analyze spreadsheets and to constantly work on them to perfect them. 
	<br><br>Excel has been a major part of my life growing up. Being a 90s child, as Excel was born in the early 90s as well, I grew up on a computer. I was bred into the technological age and used computers throughout most of my childhood and schoolings. Technology can be used to our advantages in so many ways. 
	<br><br>In several business classes and mathematical classes I had to use Excel along with other programs such as STATA, to accomplish projects. One particular project I enjoyed using was a Financial Analysis of two corporations in my ACC 201 class.  We had to analyze companies accounting reports and determine which company performed better in regards to their accounts and assets. Another excel assignment I had was in my EC 420 Class, which I’m currently in. We were assigned to use different equations and Stats; p-values, t-values, to formulate and create a formula to find how a hypothesis with stats to approve/ disprove a hypothesis. 
	<br><br>In today’s world, excel is used in the entire business and financial world. In the stock market, where I want to work, spreadsheets are constantly updated to show the changes and events of certain companies. To determine financial inputs and a companies Balance sheets and check books, general ledgers, other financial transactions, etc. Technology is very closely related to economics. Without our high dependency on technology and the changes in government, private markets, and other institutions, the world could collapse. Before the creation of excel and prior spreadsheets software programs, everything was written by hand on paper and with general ledger books and in notebooks. New data analysis tools help company’s track and visualize their data for greater insight, plus more ways to share their data. 
<br><br>Other experiences that I’ve experienced that led to my choice of economics with a specialization in excel was a short time internship with a private company for their shipments. I was responsible for taking invoices of shipments and sales and converting them to spreadsheets. Thousands of invoices numbers, reference numbers, account numbers, dates, dollar signs, etc. Also responsible for reports of write offs.  These experiences with excel and spreadsheets in my everyday life and careers were a clear directive towards an economic major. 
<br><br>	Excel is so important for all companies, many companies even if they still use a ledger without computer capability could advance to a technological advanced automated system to improve their accounts and financial reporting’s. Engineers & mathematicians use spreadsheets in so many aspects of their jobs as well.  In my chosen economics field, spreadsheets help to find averages quicker, totals, minimums, maximums, help adjust categorized, and easier to read than handwritten with all kinds of fonts. Excel can also do 100s of graphs, and tables to help with employee scheduling, and reviews for proposals or any kind of need for them. I have become very passionate about the use of excel and enjoy using a 10 key, or the 10 numbers on a key pad on most keyboards, to quickly input data. Even though it can get tiresome and repetitive, it’s still a great useful function. Excel and other Microsoft functions such as word, PowerPoint, etc. have become such an asset to everyday life and the normal person that anyone can now compete in today’s world. Most companies require at least a basic knowledge of computer skills, such as word, excel, email, etc.. The advancement of technological spreadsheets on electronic copies help for audits, taxes, and others to help review close files and understand processes.  Excel is a large facet in my life still. I don’t use a checkbook by hand anymore and many of my bank statements are online now so I can easily covert them to my own spreadsheets. In my CSE 101 class, we also had to use excel and I did very well for the bridge tasks and the assignments we were assigned.
