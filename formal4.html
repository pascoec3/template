<h2></h2>Interview with Economist/ research:Scott *******

<p></p></Mp>Chris: Why did you want to major in economics? 

<P>Scott: Because I’ve always been fascinated on how the government works and been interested in the business side of
things on how operations and companies do business with each other. 

<P>Chris: What do you do relating to economics?

<P>Scott: I work for a private company dealing with foreclosures, bankruptcies, and loan mortgages. I am responsible for 
all analyses of reporting summaries. 

<P>Chris: What kind of research do you do outside of work?

<P>Scott: I always read the news and paper to see any new reports in the economy on gas prices, unemployment rates,
inflation, etc. 

<P>Chris: What would you like to see different in the economy?

<P>Scott: I would like to see many major differences in the economy, times have rapidly changes and the world has gotten 
smaller. Education is a top priority for me and so is unemployment.  

<P>Chris: Final thing to ask; what expectations do you expect for future economists and current economic majors?

<P>Scott: I expect that the world could have some very bright economists soon and will provide very useful qualities and
efforts into our economy. 


<h2></h2>Interview with Economics/ practice: Cary *****

<P>Chris: Why did you want to major in economics?

<P>Cary: I switched my major to Economics from Business Management because I didn’t get accepted to the business college
and switched majors. 

<P>Chris: What do you do relating to economics?

<P>Cary: I previously worked for the Federal Reserve and now currently am retired. 

<P>Chris: What kind of research do you do outside of work?

<P>Cary: I still keep in touch with many previous employees and old friends and joke about current condition within our 
government. Along with attending seminars, and presentations by fellow economists about recent updates and discoveries.


<P>Chris: What would you like to see different in the economy?

<P>Cary: There are many things I would like to see different. For one the unemployment rate, Stats show the rise and
changes in unemployment rates over the years and have been increasing. There have been discussions in different states
of increasing minimum wage laws, I totally agree with higher minimum wages due to the increased cost of living in so
many areas. Inflation rates have gone down over the last few years and I would prefer to see them continue to decrease.
Most different I would like to see in the economy is the growth of the Gross Domestic Product and the increase
production of goods and services within the US. 

<P>Chris: Final thing to ask; what expectations do you expect for future economists and current economic majors?

<P>Cary: I understand there will always be a need for economists in the world. Economists are a very viable important
asset to society and economies. They are some of the hardest working people and you can meet some of the best people 
with an economics degree.
