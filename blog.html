                <p> The purpose of this video, Randy Potts memorizes and recites a poem about himself
                who read a letter to his gay Uncle Ronnie, who met an untimely death in June of 1982.The purpose is to 
                give hope to LGBT youth. The video reveals an author to announce the words of the poem and to give 
                hope to those that feel indifferent about sexuality and love. Oral Robert's gay grandson speaks out
                that things do get better even if you are gay.  The video's attempts to achieve its purpose by using a person to speak 
                clearly and with a grabbing voice to capture the attention of it's viewers and to help people who are 
                struggling with LGBT lifestyles that it does get better. The speaker certainly achieves its purpose
                by using a little personal background of the poem and to not struggle with the memorization. The Video
                is very well as a narrative. The video attempts to achiev eits purpose of success for those who are LGBT. 
                The structure of the message is clear. The reader memorizes the poem and recites it with background 
                music, visual imagery, and with passion to entrigue the viewers of the video. The speaker
                uses the words of the poem to attract the viewers to think about their own life. The video starst with
                the actual words of the poem, parapgrpah by paragraph, and then the speaker to reecite the poem from 
                memory. The Video's project can help me revise my lived experiences project by, using more personal facts of my 
                lfie and include a better story. 

<h1>In Class Activity 2</h1>
<p></p>The people targeted in the video are the character in the online game, World of Warcraft.
The social issue at hand is the obsession with wanting to continue playing and the obsession with wanting to take
out this one certain character who keeps on killing everyone else. They continue to play the game for 2 months for 
21 hours a day, killing low-level boards in the forests to gain extra points. The video’s creator’s view on this 
social is: that the boy’s characters have no personal lives at all They see this as a chance to stop the griefer 
since he will end Warcraft's popularity if he is not stopped.  Determined to help the boys slay the evil griefer,
the executives decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths. </p>

<h1></h1>In Class Activity 3</h1>
<p></p>A discussion about this advertisement’s use of imagery of Detroit includes: Pictures and locations all over Detroit. 
From the houses there, to the major tourist’s attraction pieces to plants, broken down buildings, downtown, statues, 
the people that live/ work there, paintings, the constant images of the Chrysler 300, and the Fox Theater. 

The inclusion of Eminem’s “lose yourself’, shows a great choice for dramatic background music, and shows great
effectiveness to attract the viewer and notice more. 

The Tagline “Imported from Detroit”, shows more direct and bring back that the Big 3 are still in business and shows
buyers where their cars are actually being made and produced.  The headquarters for Chrysler is in Detroit. 

The Voiceover, has its own effectiveness by using a deeper man’s voice, with calm words and to help you think about
your own lives and to actually think about their feelings about Detroit. How Detroit does things.
