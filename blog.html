                <p> The purpose of this video, Randy Potts memorizes and recites a poem about himself
                who read a letter to his gay Uncle Ronnie, who met an untimely death in June of 1982.The purpose is to 
                give hope to LGBT youth. The video reveals an author to announce the words of the poem and to give 
                hope to those that feel indifferent about sexuality and love. Oral Robert's gay grandson speaks out
                that things do get better even if you are gay.  The video's attempts to achieve its purpose by using a person to speak 
                clearly and with a grabbing voice to capture the attention of it's viewers and to help people who are 
                struggling with LGBT lifestyles that it does get better. The speaker certainly achieves its purpose
                by using a little personal background of the poem and to not struggle with the memorization. The Video
                is very well as a narrative. The video attempts to achiev eits purpose of success for those who are LGBT. 
                The structure of the message is clear. The reader memorizes the poem and recites it with background 
                music, visual imagery, and with passion to entrigue the viewers of the video. The speaker
                uses the words of the poem to attract the viewers to think about their own life. The video starst with
                the actual words of the poem, parapgrpah by paragraph, and then the speaker to reecite the poem from 
                memory. The Video's project can help me revise my lived experiences project by, using more personal facts of my 
                lfie and include a better story.
