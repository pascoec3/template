                <h1>In Class Activity 1 Blog</h1>
                <p> The purpose of this video, Randy Potts memorizes and recites a poem about himself
                who read a letter to his gay Uncle Ronnie, who met an untimely death in June of 1982.The purpose is to 
                give hope to LGBT youth. The video reveals an author to announce the words of the poem and to give 
                hope to those that feel indifferent about sexuality and love. Oral Robert's gay grandson speaks out
                that things do get better even if you are gay.  The video's attempts to achieve its purpose by using a person to speak 
                clearly and with a grabbing voice to capture the attention of it's viewers and to help people who are 
                struggling with LGBT lifestyles that it does get better. The speaker certainly achieves its purpose
                by using a little personal background of the poem and to not struggle with the memorization. The Video
                is very well as a narrative. The video attempts to achiev eits purpose of success for those who are LGBT. 
                The structure of the message is clear. The reader memorizes the poem and recites it with background 
                music, visual imagery, and with passion to entrigue the viewers of the video. The speaker
                uses the words of the poem to attract the viewers to think about their own life. The video starst with
                the actual words of the poem, parapgrpah by paragraph, and then the speaker to reecite the poem from 
                memory. The Video's project can help me revise my lived experiences project by, using more personal facts of my 
                lfie and include a better story. 

<h1>In Class Activity 2</h1>
<p></p>The people targeted in the video are the character in the online game, World of Warcraft.
The social issue at hand is the obsession with wanting to continue playing and the obsession with wanting to take
out this one certain character who keeps on killing everyone else. They continue to play the game for 2 months for 
21 hours a day, killing low-level boards in the forests to gain extra points. The video’s creator’s view on this 
social is: that the boy’s characters have no personal lives at all They see this as a chance to stop the griefer 
since he will end Warcraft's popularity if he is not stopped.  Determined to help the boys slay the evil griefer,
the executives decide to give the boys the Sword of a Thousand Truths. </p>

<h1>In Class Activity 3</h1>
<p></p>A discussion about this advertisement’s use of imagery of Detroit includes: Pictures and locations all over Detroit. 
From the houses there, to the major tourist’s attraction pieces to plants, broken down buildings, downtown, statues, 
the people that live/ work there, paintings, the constant images of the Chrysler 300, and the Fox Theater. 

The inclusion of Eminem’s “lose yourself’, shows a great choice for dramatic background music, and shows great
effectiveness to attract the viewer and notice more. 

The Tagline “Imported from Detroit”, shows more direct and bring back that the Big 3 are still in business and shows
buyers where their cars are actually being made and produced.  The headquarters for Chrysler is in Detroit. 

The Voiceover, has its own effectiveness by using a deeper man’s voice, with calm words and to help you think about
your own lives and to actually think about their feelings about Detroit. How Detroit does things. 


<h2>Weekly Blogs</h2>

<p></p>Week 1  1/8/14
In this first week, we did not have class due to the persistent frigid temperatures and dangerous winter storm.  We
were emailed separate instructions to us on how the Lived Experience project was to be set up.  As this week began,
I have not learned anything new to improve my writing techniques. My progress has not yet developed in this class. 
This week is easy because we did not have anything to do yet and all we have had to do was read the syllabus and to 
re-read the website materials to make sure how the class is structured and to keep focused on the tasks at hand so 
that items would be completed on time and in the right manner. At this point I still had the same amount of skills 
and techniques that I have used from my previous WRA class and from other classes I have taken along with my
knowledge’s and experiences from high school. My analysis of my learning so far is still the same as my analysis 
that I have done from before this class. My learning’s have not improved by I am eager to learn more and enjoy 
learning new techniques in the digital ways and rhetoric methods. This reflection blog is to keep with me throughout
this entire course throughout the semester, and I hope my learning’s will be able to help me on later in life and 
then in my careers.  However in this first week, with no class, we have learned nothing new. 


<p></p>Week 2  1/15/14
This 2nd week of class, we did not have class again due to the professor being sick.  We received another email that
morning that she would not be able to lecture and teach. We were informed again to re-read the course materials on the
course website. To read the syllabus, assignment sheet for the first assignment, and the drafting activity for 
assignment 1. We needed to read and familiarize ourselves with the syllabus and Lived Experience assignment sheet.
The drafting activity was due the next week.  We also were informed about how to set up out github and the introduction
PowerPoint for the class.  We also had to begin working on our codecademy web fundamentals tracks unit 1. At this point
I began to look over the criteria for the first assignment to begin my rough draft for my lived experience project.
For our first major assignment in this course, we needed to create a narrative detailing how a specific piece of 
technology has impacted my choice of a major/career at the present time.  I began my rough draft about how excel has
impacted me in my way of life to choose my current major of economics. I have enjoyed how excel has become very 
advanced and useful in every part of our lives.  I analyze my learning my thinking hard about the best option to use
for this piece of writing and began my rough draft to turn in by next week. My learning had progressed just a little
bit even though we still had not had a class to attend or a professor to talk with. 


<p></p>Week 3  1/22/14
In this 3rd week of class, we finally were able to meet for the first time in an actual class setting. In class, our 
draft of our lived experiences paper was due in class. Our codecademy web fundamentals track unit 2, html structure
using lists was due online. We also had to continue working on our lived experiences project, which was due online one
week away at midnight.  At this part of the course, I began learning a lot more in terms of html writing and learned 
much to work on building lists on websites and using new paragraphs with different headings and much more. Our drafts
that were due in class, were placed in groups of 4, our other members had to peer edit our drafts and give advice on 
the directions for our papers to take and how we could improve our writings.  Having another person edit your writings
before you submit a final copy is very useful and it’s much better to have another set of eyes look at something before
it’s finished. They are able to help analyze better than your own mind when it’s only concentrated on a certain few 
things. Also when you edit another’s you can help them fix their essays and are grateful. I analyze my learning to 
beginning to be productive especially in the areas of computer technologies and html formats. 


<p></p>Week 4  1/29/14
This week our lived experiences project was due at midnight. So before hand I triple checked my essay to make sure that
it would be within all the guidelines required and that my paper was the best of my abilities.  We did not meet in
class again due to the teacher canceling class.  The agenda was to complete the lived Experience project by midnight
on D2L as a .pdf or word document. We also needed to enter the URL for our web versions in the comment. We were also 
assigned to work on in class activity 2 and the drafting activity for the 2nd project.  We also were advised to work 
on our codecademy web activities: Track unit 3 (HTML structure: tables, Divs, Spans). An analysis of my learning so 
far was more development in my abilities for HTML content and web creations. It was a challenge to upload my github 
profile working and for me to upload my essay into a web format.  Our draft of our cultural analysis was due in one 
week so I decided to work on that and get it out of the way. This assignment asked me, through the analysis of a
cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issues and its import on society. We need to provide a thoughtful
analysis of what our artifact contributes to the discussion of our social issue. Finally to propose a solution that
helps or possibly solves the social issue in question.  We would need to change our ways of writing for this paper 
and adhere strictly to the conventions of either MLA or APA format. 


<p></p>Week 5  2/5/14
This week our draft of our cultural analysis project was due at midnight. Also more codecademy web fundamentals tracks
were due.  Due to the bigger size this project was to be in length, 1800-2100, I knew I needed to commit more time and
effort into completing this. This proposal was formal and was a significant type of document in the technical workplace.
I needed to select an artifact, video games, and explain how that illustrate or depict either a group of people or in
a social issue. Then to provide thoughtful analysis of what my artifact contributed to the discussion of my social 
issue.  We needed to have the following sections: Executive summary, background analysis, description of the issue, 
proposed solution, anticipated results/ effects, conclusion.  An analysis of my learning in this part of the course,
At this point in my progress in learning for this course, I learned more about how the essay would be built and what
sources I could be using. I needed to look up examples of MLA and APA styles for my assistance in completing this 
assignment.  The online work, codecademy is beginning to be very helpful and I actually enjoy writing in HTML format 
and also using CSS.  My cultural analysis project, since due to the increased violence in teenagers from video games,
is close to me, since I also enjoy, it was very insightful to find other sources to use and find a barrage of 
information. My cultural analysis is very intriguing and I hope it will eventually be fixed. 


<p></p>Week 6  2/12/14
This week our Cultural Analysis project is due at midnight. More Codecademy Web fundamentals, CSS classes and ID’s were
also assigned for us to work on.  I completed my assignment but struggled to load it properly onto my github profile.
We were introduced to our formal research project. Our earlier assignments for the course gave me the opportunity to 
identify themes and terms for analysis so that I could begin to understand and practice meeting the expectations for
writing in higher education. This assignment allowed me to continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision,
style, and delivery practices. It introduced me to the ways that research and participating in important academic 
discussions prepare me to use literacy in successful ways across the kinds of writing situations that I may find in
higher education and, perhaps, beyond.  For this assignment, it gave me the opportunity to begin building my own
understanding of how writing, reading, and researching operate within a discipline. We needed an analysis of at least
one scholarly article, at least one article from a trade publication, conduct an interview with a person who practices 
in a field related to economics, and an interview with a person who teaches major courses and or does research.  
An analysis of this assignment for my learning in this course is that I spent many hours working on this assignment
and needed to commit time to complete it within the requirements and expectations. My progress ahs improved from my 
writing techniques and having a friend to review my drafts and assignments definitely does help to complete them. 


<p></p>Week 7  2/19/14
This week we continued work on our formal research projects. We also were assigned more codecademy work for us; web
fundamentals track unit 6 (CSS Element positioning). This week our annotated bibliography was due at midnight. For
this assignment, we needed to find 5 sources for our research project that we identified for our paper in the library
activity, then compile an annotated bibliography in which we would correctly cite each source in either APA or MLA
format, then provide an adequately developed annotation that both identifies the main arguments of the source and what
the source potentially contributes to our projects. I used the MSU library websites and programs to search for proper
sources that I would sue for my project.  I went to ProQuest database through the MSU libraries’ Electronic Resources 
page.  We also were assigned a library activity worksheet, in which we need to answer a multitude of questions in 
relation to our scholarly or trade articles, then more work to help us find more similar items that we would be able
to use.  This week was very helpful because by using MSU’s electronic databases I was able to find many more articles
that I could use for my project.  I am learning much more when it comes to finding more adequate proper sources and 
not just using Wikipedia, which already has the sources, but you can’t just copy and paste. In pursuit of my goals for
this project I was able to work more on a rough draft with many more sources and find more words to choose from in 
order to fulfill the requirements. 


<p></p>Week 8 2/26/14
This week we were assigned to continue work with our formal research project. This project was a very major portion of
our final grade, so I realized that I would have to put more work into this assignment. This assignment allowed me to
continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision, style, and delivery practices. It introduced me to the 
ways that research and participating in important academic discussions prepare me to use literacy in successful ways 
across the kinds of writing situations that I may find in higher education and, perhaps, beyond.  For this assignment,
it gave me the opportunity to begin building my own understanding of how writing, reading, and researching operate 
within a discipline. His assignment had to be at least 2,700 to 3,000 words in length. Also to include multiple visuals 
that communicate specific, important pieces of information; graphs and charts would be commonly used for this purpose.
Our drafting activity for our formal research project was due on this day as well, which was basically just our rough
draft for the assignment which we would upload online for others to be able to peer-edit. For the Formal research
drafting activity, we needed to: write a statement of purpose for our report, describe the discipline that I would
be researching briefly, describe the role and function of research in that discipline, characterize the role that
technology plays in the discipline. Compose a draft of the executive summary for our report (incorporating the ideas
above) and discussions of at least two sources. 


<p></p>Week 9  3/5/14
We did not have class this week because it was over SPRING BREAK.  We still needed to work on our formal research
project. This project was a very major portion of our final grade, so I realized that I would have to put more work 
into this assignment. This assignment allowed me to continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision, 
style, and delivery practices. It introduced me to the ways that research and participating in important academic

and or does research.  An analysis of this assignment for my learning in this course is that I spent many hours 
working on this assignment and needed to commit time to complete it within the requirements and expectations.


<p></p>Week 10  3/12/14
This week we focused on continuing to work on our formal research projects. We only had one week to finish it. This
project was a very major portion of our final grade, so I realized that I would have to put more work into this 
assignment. This assignment allowed me to continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision, style, and 
delivery practices. It introduced me to the ways that research and participating in important academic discussions

this assignment and needed to commit time to complete it within the requirements and expectations.


<p></p>Week 11  3/19/14
We did not meet in class this week. This week our Formal Research projects were due at midnight. Also we were
introduced to our multimodal remix project. This project gave me the opportunity to revise and transmediate one of 
my earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose of the piece while transforming it into an alternative form 
of a short documentary. We needed to work in groups on the documentary and the work needed to be based on one of our 
works earlier in the semester.  What we chose to create was a documentary advocating a position on a particular social
issue; we chose to use my previous Cultural analysis proposal project about video games and violence.  The assignment 
requirements were to return to the topic, audience, and purpose of the earlier project. Expand upon and strengthen this
work so my text more fully achieves my purpose as a writer. Then radically and purposefully shift my work from the
original mode and genre, literally “transmediating” it into another form that fulfills the same purpose as the original,
but more effectively. Purposefully and meaningfully integrate more than one mode of communication, not just 
alphabetically or visual or aural. We also submitted a proposal for our framework. Including a working hypothesis and
interpretation, topic, action sequences, deriving each intended sequences, participants, conflict, audience biases, 
on-camera interviews, structure, and resolution. An analysis of my learning for this week included how we would work
together as group and divide up the work between us in order to complete the assignment. I reflect back and think of
how important this is for my grade.

back and think of how important this is for my grade.  I learned more about how to build a video/ documentary again
and input all videos, links, and recordings together. 


<p></p>Week 13  4/2/14
This week we continued to work on our Multimedia research project. My group members and I had to meet many times to
discuss our objectives and how we would distribute our responsibilities and find times for us to meet for recordings,
find sources, video tape, and build the final project together. This project gave me the opportunity to revise and
transmediate one of my earlier projects, strengthening the original purpose of the piece while transforming it into an
alternative form of a short documentary. We needed to work in groups on the documentary and the work needed to be

one mode of communication, not just alphabetically or visual or aural. An analysis of my learning in this course has 
been of many technological and writing techniques. I have learned much when it comes to HTML and CSS formatting.,
along with the ability to narrow down on topics. 


<p></p>Week 14  4/9/14
This week we continued to work on our multimedia research project. We also were introduced to our final retrospective 
project.  This assignment asked me to reread the reports and projects that I have created this semester to meet the
following goals: Use writing for purposes of reflection, action, and participation in academic inquiry. Engage in
reading for the purposes of reflection, critical analysis, decision- making, and inquiry. Read in ways that improve 
writing, especially by demonstrating an ability to analyze invention, arrangement and revision strategies at work in 
a variety of texts. Exercise a flexible repertoire of invention, arrangement, and revision strategies. Demonstrate an
understanding of research as epistemic and recursive processes that arise from and respond back to various communities.
I also would have to write a final progress report for this course that revisits and revises your individual literacy 
history for a specific purpose of revisiting and revising for the purpose of helping incoming students understand the
big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program. The important thing to remember 
as you construct the final project is that the final product should help you both 1) revise your individual literacy 
autobiography in a significant way by drawing on course materials and activities and 2) create strong points of 
significance (i.e. strong purpose/audience/subject relationships) within and across each of four course assignments.

<p></p>Week 15  4/16/14

This week, we worked to continue our final retrospective project. We also submitted our Multimodal remix project on
this date. Our drafts of the final retrospective project were due in class. This assignment asked me to reread the 
reports and projects that I have created this semester to meet the following goals: Use writing for purposes of
