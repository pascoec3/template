<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
<p>Writing, Rhetoric, and American Cultures: 110; science and technology has been a very interesting experience for me.
We completed so many large and small projects including the Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, 
the Formal Research Project, the Multimedia Remix Project, the Course Retrospective Project, blogs, and the Course
Retrospective Project. Technology is an enormous part of today’s society. Through this writing course we were asked to
complete five projects in which they all had some relations with technology. These projects taught us students in the 
class how to become more advanced in our writing and gave us knowledge that we may need in future writing experiences.
Reading and writing is very crucial to be educated on if you want to be successful and or intellectual in life.
Although I personally am not majoring in anything related to writing, it is always beneficial to be able to adequately
form a paper, especially when it comes to applying for jobs, and continuing my college education. We were told that 
our section would focus on the skills, attitudes, and knowledge to hopefully enhance reading, writing, and research 
in today’s world, and that "specifically we would look at issues and concepts dealing with digital technology and visual rhetoric to think about what we know about literacy."
	The Lived Experienced Project narrative detailing how a specific piece of technology has impacted my choice of a
	major/career at the present time. To complete this report we needed to identify an academic or professional career
	track for ourselves.  Then identify and describe one piece of technology that has led me to choose that particular
	field.  Finally, to describe in detail the experiences with technology that related to my chosen major; which is 
	economics. I personally enjoyed writing the lived experiences project because it helped me realize why I chose my
	major and were I would be going in life. For this particular assignment, I decided to write about excel and how it
	has impacted my choice of a major. In fact, not everyone might be familiar with the major we chose or the piece of
	technology we intended to describe. Therefore, it was important that we were able to convey the necessary information
	for the reader to understand, but at the same time not give too many superficial details, so that the reader would
	still be interested and continued to read on. The tone of this assignment was a more informal one, even allowing us
	to write in the first person throughout the paper. Another requirement of this paper was to describe a personal 
	experience that has helped us in deciding to pursue our major, or that has otherwise influenced our major. I decided
	to talk about how using Excel at my one job helped to influence me for my decision of my major. Even though this
	kind of writing might not be too frequent in other college courses or academic settings, it would still probably 
	turn out to be suited for other occasions in life.
	The Cultural Analysis Project was to select an artifact of popular culture (a video game, a music video, a movie, 
	a TV show, etc.) and explain how that artifact illustrates or depicts either a group of people or social issue. Then
	provide a thoughtful analysis of what our artifact contributes to the discussion of our social issue. Finally, 
	to propose a solution that helps or possibly solves the social issue in question. This assignment asked us, through
	the analysis of a cultural artifact, to investigate a specific social issue and its import on society.  For me I 
	decided to write about video games and their influence it can have on teenagers, leading to violence. It had been 
	scientifically and statistically proven that violence from teenagers was linked to the playing of video games. This
	project required us to make a further step towards a more formal type of writing.  In this assignment as well, it
	was important for us to consider carefully our audience to make sure that the understanding of the main message would
	be complete. To achieve this it is necessary to conduct some research and possibly find studies that support our 
	statements I believe, that this project was particularly useful in learning to take into careful consideration the
	audience, and what type of information it might need to understand the content of the essay.
	The Formal Research Report allowed you to continue engaging effective invention, arrangement, revision, style, and 
	delivery practices. For this project we had to do an analysis of at least one scholarly article from our discipline.
	We also needed an Analysis of at least one article from a trade publication related to that discipline. Also, to 
	conduct an interview with a person who teaches major courses and/or does research in that discipline. Along with an
	interview with a person who practices in a field related to that discipline. It needed to include multiple visuals
	that communicate specific, important pieces of information. This assignment required us to take into consideration
	the types of communication used within a chosen field, and specifically our major, as well as the importance of 
	technology within that field. For this, I had to do much more research in my particular field using the MSU’s 
	electronic databases and find particular articles especially in terms of personal finance and economics with the
	government. One further step compared to the first two assignments that this project required was, as I mentioned 
	earlier, to conduct research as well as interview two experts in the field. I think that the ability to conduct
	research and interview, as well as critically analyze the information gathered, is the main thing I learned from 
	this assignment. This would be a very useful school in college as well as later in life. 
	The Multimedia Remix project was a documentary advocating a position on a particular social issue.  The fourth
	assignment, asked us to turn one of our previous project into a short documentary. By doing so we explored another
	form of communication. In fact, in addition to taking into consideration the audience by carefully weighing the 
	information that we provided, which we had already done in the previous assignments, we had to pay particular 
	attention at the design of our video as it was the main means of communication with the audience. For this project,
	my group members and I decided to work back on my previous cultural analysis project. We agreed it was the best
	option to do our assignment on. So we discussed more in depth about violence in video games and the effects it can 
	have in real life. The purpose was to strengthen the original document while also shifting the work into a different
	mode and genre. So while creating our documentary our group had to keep these things in mind as well as trying to 
	enhance our writing, so having strong literacies and rhetoric not only written but, visually and orally as well. 

All of these projects were very helpful to meet all of the course goals: to use writing for purposes of reflection, action, and participation in academic inquiry. I was able to read in ways that improve writing, especially by demonstrating an ability to analyze invention, arrangement, and revision strategies at work in a variety of texts. This final progress report for this course that revisits and revises our individual literacy history for a specific purpose of revisiting and revising for the purpose of helping incoming students understand the big picture of First-Year Writing to enhance their chances of success in the Program. In conclusion, all assignments were useful in teaching us different types of communication, as well as always considering what the audience is likely to already know about the topic and what, on the contrary, needs more explanation. What I think I gathered from the lived experiences project was how to write in a more informal way while at the same time providing interesting and maybe even useful information. From the cultural analysis assignment my biggest taking is the ability to keep the audience, along with the necessity for backup for my statements. The formal research project helped me learn how to conduct research and interviews, but most of all to be able to use that information to support my statements, while providing useful information to the audience. The final remix project’s main teaching to me was the ability to use another type of communication, such as a video documentary, in an effective way. I was able to learn many new techniques in this class and revise my individual literacy history for a specific purpose of revisiting and revising for the purpose of helping incoming students. Thinking back I realize that, I have revise my individual literacy autobiography in a significant way by drawing on course materials and activities, as well as creating strong points of significance within and across each of 4 course assignments; the Lived Experiences Project, the Cultural Analysis Project, the Formal Research Project, and the Multimedia Remix Project, along with this current assignment. All of the projects were definitely challenging for me and depending on the project, it had its easy and hard parts about it. Not only it was challenging, but also I have learn something from all of the topics given as a project
