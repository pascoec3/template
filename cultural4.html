			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
			<p>A major social issue today relating to Call of Duty is the present conditions of players
			and how they act in real life. Players have showed their depictions said before in real life.
			They enjoy the games so much; they show them in real life. The development of these different
			entertaining activities has lead to the depictions of Terrorism, destruction, violence,
			stratagem, teamwork, hand-eyed coordination, and bloodshed. Not a social issue, as much as 
			knowledge, but it has been proven that many players have enlisted in the military with aspects of life in the military similar to a video game. Those who have played as shown to have more teamwork skills, more knowledge of military tactics and better hand-eye coordination. 
			Many of the most recent versions of Call of Duty has set scenes in the Middle East and showed 
			areas similar to Iraqi Wars and relates to well known terrorist organizations. Depictions of
			persons in the games and the way they are dressed, talk, act in the games can be misinterpreted
			as a terrorist depiction and image. 
	Throughout every scene of the stages of the games, there are explosions; there are demolished buildings, scenes
	of deterioration and devastation. A certain social issue that relates to the sounds and acts of demolition in
	this series of games is the actual destruction in real life. When players hear the booms and explosions, the
	y want to hear them in real life too. So many enjoy firing of weapons and firearms, and smaller based 
	explosions.  I myself enjoy the sounds of gunfire and explosions in real life. People believe that it can be 
	just like a video game when firing real live, deadly weapons and can make very poor choices that can harm 
	themselves or others.  
	The violence and non-stop action throughout these 1st/3rd person shooter games is compelling and satisfying 
	but disappointing. Players can get really intoned with the way they play and result in violence. Competitors
	who compete in tournament competitions and social media networking groups take them very seriously. Participant
	shave responded with violence in real life causing small forms of destruction; such as, destruction of
	televisions, consoles, walls, windows, etc. 
	As mentioned earlier, as not much as a social issues, but a benefit to contestants, the strategy’s played by
	online and multiplayer situations leads to the use of strategy to accomplish missions and defeat their
	opponents. Players can learn standard military tactics to complete missions, learn military lingo, and maturity
	displayed by A.I. ‘Artificial Intelligence’.  
	Teamwork, a very valuable characteristic and social skill needed to succeed in the world today are also used. 
	Online players and mission challengers have to rely on their teammates to accomplish goals, to revive another,
	to help ‘cover one’s back’. Players can depend on one another to guard a flank and to help take down targets.
	When players work together and succeed they can become really good connections and improve their relationships
	together. When they fail, aggressions and tensions can build up.  
	It has been proven that those who play video games have better hand eye coordination than those who don’t. Even 
	other style of games can improve one’s coordination and reflex timing. Helping those anticipate what can happen
	next and make dangerous or safe decisions in their own lives. With better reflexes it can help to defend 
	yourself in real life from attacks, playing sports, etc.. 
	Bloodshed, there is a lot of blood splattering and gore to be shown in today’s world. The simulators can show
	blood splattering from opponents from explosions or gunshots. They can also show blood splatter if the player
	is shot, to show injury and the need to rest. The major thing to be concerned with is there is no fear, players
	will keep playing even if hit or injured in the simulator, but it is just a simulator, they can’t be hurt by 
	these bullets. In real life, gunfire is much louder, very real, and deadly. 
	This is a very serious issue in today’s economy, players who commit their lives or play just for fun 
	sporadically, begin to show signs and symptoms of Call of Duty. It is obvious that Xfinity ward has created a
	very successful franchise and Mature based symptoms, but even if a person is not old enough to purchase,
	parents can still buy for their children or older friend, etc. Players can commit countless hours of playing
	time which can take away very important things in life, such as school, work, relationships, etc. Myself, 
	being a Call of Duty player, I have experienced first hand the effects of being involved in. 
	There are multiple disadvantages but also advantages of playing shooter games. It actually does help to 
	improve a shooters vision, many updates and better software programs do help to analyze the aspect of shooting
	with a scope or down the sights, however fails to help imagine the weight of a rifle, machine gun, handgun,
	etc. Users can make mistakes in real life as if they were a video game. This is a problem when it comes to 
	real soldiers. In a video game, you can only just retry a mission or restart, but in real life, there is no 
	restart or re-try. The danger is real, which is why it takes real courage to want to dedicate your life to 
	serve. There are still many payers who do not display a sense of rage, anger, and violence, from playing. 
	The more played, the better skills are developed and better a player can anticipate movements and be able 
	to move up in rankings. Players get points for numbers of kills to death, and completing mission or objectives.
