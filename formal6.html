"The study of demand for media products requires an understanding of audience members' preferences, which are shaped by their taste for content," scientists writing in the Journal of Media Economics report.
"Despite the central role of content in understanding some aspects of media economics, media economics scholars sometimes apply content analysis in ways that are inconsistent with the generally accepted practices of the method. This article deals with some basic concepts underlying the method of content analysis to familiarize media economics scholars with the method," wrote F.G. Fico and colleagues, Michigan State University.
The researchers concluded: "The adoption of accepted content analysis practices will yield better data and, in the long-run, help advance the understanding of media economics."
Fico and colleagues published their study in the Journal of Media Economics (A content analysis guide for media economics scholars. Journal of Media Economics, 2008;21(2):114-130).

<p></p>Analysis of Scholarly Article:  

<p></p>“ This study looks at two distinct questions: 'what have been the most influential journal articles in environmental economics and ecological economics over the 10-year period 1994-2003?’ and 'how much overlap is there between the fields of environmental and ecological economics?' We examine the references in all articles published in JEEM and Ecological Economics (EE) over this period. For each of these two fields, a list of the top articles and top journals cited by articles published in JEEM and EE is presented. We also present some results based on our study of the ISI Journal Citation Reports. We find that there is a significant overlap between the two fields at the journal level--the two journals cite similar journals. There is a correlation of 0.34 between the number of citations received by the journals that are most cited and the correlation is even higher if journal self-citation is excluded. The main differences are that ecological economics tends to cite (but not be cited by) general natural science journals more often than environmental economics does, environmental economics cites more heavily from journals rather than other publications, and citations in environmental economics are more concentrated on particular journals and individual publications. However, there is much less similarity at the level of individual articles. Non-market valuation articles dominate the most cited articles in JEEM while green accounting, sustainability, and the environmental Kuznets curve are all prominent topics in EE”. (Chunbo)  

To explain: Experimenters and economists are trying to discover what have been the most influential journal articles in environmental economics and ecological economics over the last 10 years and how much overlap is there between the field of environmental and ecological economics.  There is a correlation and overlap between the two fields at the journal level. There is a correlation of 0.34 between the number of citations received by the journals that are most cited and the correlation is even higher if journal self-citation is excluded. Which means for every 100 citations of ecological economics there are 34 citations of environmental economics. The main differences are that ecological economics tends to cite general natural science journals more often than environmental economics does, environmental economics cites more heavily from journals rather than other publications and citations in environmental economics are more concentrated on particular journals and individual publications



To explain: Despite the central role of content in understanding some aspects of media economics, media economics scholars sometimes apply content analysis in ways that are inconsistent with the generally accepted practices of the method. The adoption of accepted content analysis practices will yield better data and, in the long run, help advance the understanding of media economics. “The field of media economics has mushroomed recently, highlighted by the introduction of the Journal of Media Economics, an expanding literature base, and wider interest among academicians.” (Albarran)
