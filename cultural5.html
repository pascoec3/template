			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There have been many proposed solutions to abstain from these issues, some of completely
			canceling the use of violence in video games; meaning 100s of people would be out of work and
			companies to shut down. Others have done research to make sure those who buying do not already
			display a history of aggression.  Those who believe these games mostly rated M for mature
			should be taken away are either done so by family or friends or encouraged by them. I do not
			believe there could ever be a full expulsion of violence in video games due to the excitement
			and the high number of followers. It could be possible if government agencies and laws were
			passed that those playing could be charged with a crime or citation, etc. It’s highly unlikely
			that would happen any time in the future. Video games have developed so much over the past 
			50 years from pong, packman, and so many others that have almost gone extinct, because of the
			higher demand of newer, faster paced, excitement games. Many children learn many valuable facts
			from games today, such as animals, basic map readings, letters, colors, words, and so much more.
			
My Proposed solution is not to completely erase the existence of these archaic games, but to enforce the aftereffects.
When a person becomes angry and enraged, that’s when civil laws and bills could be enforce to issue tickets, or
possible arrests depending on the situations. The violence that follows and develops throughout these series in that
of constant escalation.
